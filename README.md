# Fetch Rewards Front End Take Home Test
This web app retreives a list of items from an API provided by Fetch Rewards.

The data is retrieved using the fetch method when the 'Get Items' button is clicked via an event-handler function.

The list of items is displayed in groups organized by List ID. The items are sorted by List ID from left to right on the page in ascending order. The list of items in each group are also sorted by name from top to bottom in ascending order.

All items where 'name' is blank or null have been removed from the list of items.
